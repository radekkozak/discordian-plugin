> for tweaking Discordian theme.

- Writer Mode
- Flat Andy Mode
- Paragraph Focus with customizable fade out
- Readable line length 
- Dark note headers (as an option for defaults)
- Customizable font sizes for notes and File Explorer

## Contribute

Found some quirks? Want to propose some new functionality? 
You can easily follow these simple steps:

1. [File an issue](https://github.com/radekkozak/discordian-plugin/issues/new) discussing proposed changes or found bug
2. If you want to contribute solution on your own please
    - clone this repo
    - `npm i` to install dependencies
    - create `config.env` from `config.env.example` and set it accordingly
    - `npm run dev` to start compilation and development in watch mode
    - do your magic
3. Commit your work
    - use commit message that best describes changes you've just made. If possible, *link it to relevant issue*  
    - **DO NOT build or commit `main.js` directly** ! It will be autogenerated and handled by CI server.  

Now sip your coffee and wait for my swift response or PR merge. Thanks !
